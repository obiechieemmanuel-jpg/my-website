<h1>Africa is a beautiful continent</h1>
<ol>
<li>Snapshot — quick facts you should know</li>
<p1>Africa is the world’s second-largest continent by land area and population. Its landmass covers roughly 30 million km² and it is home to about 1.5–1.6 billion people today, making up roughly 18–20% of the global population. Population growth and a very young age structure are the continent’s defining demographic features right now.</p1>
<li>Geography and regions</li>
<p2>here is the thing: Africa is not a single environment — it’s a mosaic.</p2>
<ul>
<li>Northern Africa is dominated by the Sahara Desert and Mediterranean climates.</li>
<li>West Africa contains coastal plains, the Sahel belt, and dense urban corridors.</li>
<li>Central Africa contains the Congo Basin, one of the largest tropical rainforests on Earth.</li>
<li>East Africa features the Great Rift Valley, highlands, and major lakes (Victoria, Tanganyika, Malawi).</li>
<li>Southern Africa mixes high plateaus, savannas, and temperate coastal zones.</li>
<p3>This geographic diversity explains Africa’s wide range of climates, ecosystems and natural resources.</p3>
<ol start="3">
</ul>
<li>People and demographics</li>
<p4>Population growth and youth bulge Africa’s population is growing faster than any other region. Most projections show substantial increases over the next 30 years, driven by high fertility rates in many countries and improving child survival. In many nations more than half the population is under 25, producing both economic potential and urgent needs for jobs, education, housing and services. Rapid urbanisation is happening alongside this growth; several African cities are on track to become megacities by 2035.</p4>
<p5>Languages, religions and identities Africa is linguistically and culturally rich — estimates put the number of languages at anywhere between about 1,200 and over 2,000. Major language families include Niger-Congo (including many Bantu languages), Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan and Khoisan. Religious adherence is diverse, with Islam dominant in much of North and parts of West Africa, Christianity prevalent across southern and central regions, and many communities practising indigenous belief systems or blends of traditions. UNESCO and linguistic surveys highlight the scale and fragility of this diversity.</p5>
<ol start="4">
</ol>
<li>A short (selective) history</li>
<p6>What this really means is that Africa’s past is deep and complex, from early hominins and sites of earliest Homo sapiens in East Africa to the rise of ancient civilizations (Egypt, Nubia), to trans-Saharan trade networks, and later coastal trade linking to Europe and Asia. The slave trades, colonial partitioning in the 19th century, and post-World War II independence movements reshaped borders and institutions. Post-independence history is varied — some countries achieved stability and growth, others faced coups, civil wars and protracted conflict. For a timeline and more detail, see comprehensive histories and academic surveys.</p6>

</ol>
<li>Politics and institutions</li>
<p7>Continental organisation and regional blocs The African Union (AU), successor to the Organisation of African Unity, is the main continental body for political cooperation and integration. Regional economic communities (ECOWAS, SADC, EAC, etc.) play major roles in trade, security and coordination. Governance is uneven: some states have strong institutions and democratic processes, while others endure fragility, military rule or prolonged conflict. The AU faces pressure to be more effective on security crises, and regional bodies often carry much of the mediation and peacekeeping load</p7>
<h2>Security landscape</h2>
<p8>Conflicts are concentrated in specific areas (parts of the Sahel, eastern DRC, Ethiopia at times, and localized violence elsewhere), while coup attempts and political instability have risen in several countries in recent years. These conflicts are rarely simple; drivers include competition for land and resources, weak institutions, external intervention, identity politics, and climate stress.</p8>

<li>Economy — patterns and numbers</li>
<p9>Overall picture Africa’s economies are diverse: petroleum and minerals underpin some states, agriculture supports many livelihoods, and services and tech are growing fast in urban centres. According to IMF and regional reporting, Africa’s largest economies by nominal GDP include South Africa, Egypt, Algeria, Nigeria and Morocco — but rankings shift with commodity cycles and exchange rate changes. Economic growth is uneven across countries and often constrained by infrastructure, governance, and global market volatility</p9>
<h3>Key sectors and trends</h3>
<ul>
<li>Natural resources: oil, gas, mining and metals remain significant export earners.</li>
<li>Agriculture: still the largest employer across much of the continent; productivity gains are a major development policy focus.</li>
<li>Services and tech: fintech, mobile money, e-commerce and digital startups are booming in cities from Nairobi to Lagos to Cape Town.</li>
<li>Manufacturing: limited but with targeted growth pockets (textiles, light manufacturing, auto assembly).Policy focus areas include improving infrastructure, creating jobs for youth, trade integration and moving up value chains.</li>
<ol start="7">
</ol>
<li>Urbanisation, infrastructure and cities</li>
<p10>Urban growth is accelerating. Cities will be central to Africa’s future economy, but growth outpaces infrastructure. Challenges include informal settlements, traffic congestion, strained utilities and gaps in health and education services. Proper urban planning and investment could convert this demographic shift into productivity gains; failure would worsen inequality and instability. Recent analyses emphasise the need for coordinated public investment and private sector engagement.</p10>
